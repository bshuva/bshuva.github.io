## Conversation to opportunities

Picture this: a cool, breezy evening spent brainstorming with Professor Ravi Poovaiah about activities for pre-nursery and nursery classes. We delved into how early-stage design thinking could work wonders for the next generation.
That's when Ravi Sir mentioned his upcoming winter course on interactive media and senses—a perfect fit for my interests since graduation. Excitedly, I proposed to assist, and he warmly agreed! Thus began one of the most thrilling experiences on my journey as an aspiring new media designer.

I jumped into my role, learning the ropes and supporting Ravi Sir. My task? To be the go-to person for students, helping them navigate project roadblocks and master the art of design thinking.
From guiding them on tools to polishing their presentations, it was all about making their ideas shine.

For our course challenge, students crafted interactive installations to raise awareness about UNESCO SDG goals, drawing from their diverse Indian backgrounds.
We emphasized using senses to engage audiences deeply—a lesson in impactful communication through design.

Throughout the three weeks, we diveded into lectures on design thinking, watched as ideas bloomed, and witnessed students crafting full-fledged prototypes by the final week.
The energy of creativity was contagious!

## My Role and Responsibilities

Assisting in this course was a game-changer. From absorbing knowledge to sharing it, I stepped into a mentorship role for the first time.
Communication was key—I bridged gaps between Ravi Sir and the students, ensuring everyone felt heard and supported.

## Projects by Students

We divided students into four groups, each tackling a pressing issue. One group sensitized people about whale extinction, another shed light on vulture decline due to human intervention.
Then, there was the group passionate about mangrove ecosystems and another highlighting bee extinction—all through innovative interactive installations.

My daily routine? Checking in on their progress, offering guidance on design tools, and even diving into technical snags. With students from diverse backgrounds, including engineering and art,
I coached them on visual storytelling and prototype creation—sometimes with the help of our resident electrical wizard, Harold.

## Reflection

The biggest lesson? _Giving insightful feedback is an art!_ Understanding class dynamics and trusting participants to shine were invaluable takeaways. Personally, this journey solidified my passion for multimedia design.
I realized I thrive on exploring various media, pushing boundaries, and challenging my creative limits.

## Concluding thoughts

This experience wasn't just impactful—it produced results! Our project "Jatayu" made waves at India's prestigious Kala Ghoda art festival, resonating deeply with the audience.

If someone had told me I'd be teaching at this stage, I would've laughed. Yet, here I am, grateful to Professor Ravi for believing in me and to the students for embracing my guidance.
Together, we've shown that age is just a number when passion and opportunity collide.'
