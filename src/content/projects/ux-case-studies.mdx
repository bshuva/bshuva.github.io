# Investment Platform Case-study
This case study explores the design process and solutions implemented in developing an innovative investment platform aimed at enhancing user experience. Through reflection and iterative design, I aimed to simplify complex financial concepts, making investing accessible to everyoneâ€”from novices to seasoned investors.
### Objective 
Design an investment platform that allows users to view and analyze their investment portfolios, receive updates on stock markets and companies they hold, 
and access detailed stock information. The platform should be intuitive, visually appealing, and provide a seamless user experience for both novice and experienced investors.

# Customer Support Dashboard
I wanted explore the nuances to design a dashboard for complaints and insights to be used by a manager and that can be scaled.
I did it as a one day practice task.

### Problem Statement
Design an admin dashboard for an AI-driven customer support tool where support managers can monitor, analyze, and improve the performance of human agents and AI bots. 
The dashboard should show key metrics like issue resolution times, customer satisfaction, and workflow improvement suggestions.

### Constraints
The dashboard should be easy for both new and experienced users.
Managers should be able to customize which KPIs they monitor based on their business goals. Include predictive analytics to provide helpful insights without confusing the user.
The design should handle a growing team or more complex tasks as the company scales.

### Things manager will like to see for the analysis of current scenario:
Workflow improvement suggestions/Insight- when is the peak time to get receive complaints, when is it least (trends -time x complaint graph), if particular. issue is prominent in the system
Filter based on particular KPIs- Important KPIs- Time taken to resolve, Failure of AI chatbot/need for human intervention, most number of issues resolved by an employee, number of issues resolved by the AI bot, customer satisfaction overview
Over all, successful support vs Pending/failed queries that still need to be solved.

**Extra questions to be considered**
- If the manager want to look at a particular chat support how will he access it? How can he monitor any particular employee?
- can he overtake an ongoing chat support, to resolve an issue if it continues for more than a day.

# Houzeo
Tech startup focused on simplifying your real estate transaction experience. Houzeo makes For Sale By Owner easy by giving you access to technologies 
only real estate agents have, including instant pricing report and closing Dashboard.

### Design Challenge Breif
Sellers  have listed their properties on the Houzeo platform, attracting  multiple offers from potential buyers or their representatives. However, sellers are facing difficulties in efficiently reviewing and comparing these offers due to the following issues:

- **Lack of Clear Differentiators**: Users struggle to discern key features and discrepancies among property offers, leading to confusion during decision-making.  
- **Poor Navigation**: Users encounter difficulties in finding relevant information due to confusing navigation structures and buried content.
- **Unclear Call to Action (CTA)**: Users need clear guidance on the next steps to take, as ambiguous or poorly positioned CTAs can hinder engagement.
- **Overwhelming Amount of Information**: Presenting users with excessive information overwhelms them, leading to decision paralysis.
